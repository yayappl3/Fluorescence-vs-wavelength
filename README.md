# Fluorescence-vs-wavelength
graphing fluorescence vs wavelength with curves for both SWCNT with analyte and SWCNT without analyte. 
Includes deltaF/F_0 (fluorescence difference) calculation that will also show in final plot
Highly recommend mounting google drive to workbook; csv files can be easily pulled from there and a png of the plot is saved to any desired folder

yessir idk what else to say its pretty straightforward
